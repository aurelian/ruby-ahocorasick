h3. Introduction

This library is a ruby extension, a wrapper around the "Aho-Corasick":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho-Corasick_algorithm implementation in C, found in "Strmat":http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/strmat.html package.

The source code (ac.c and ac.h) was "adapted" from Strmat. In fact, I've changed only 3-4 lines of code from the original implementation so it will feat my needs: search needed to return the current position in the searched string.

h3. What's the idea?

Having a dictionary of known sentences, how can I find individual patterns in an incoming stream of data? Fast.
