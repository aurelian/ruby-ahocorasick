h1. This is a work in progress.

h3. Introduction

This library is a ruby extension, a wrapper around the "Aho-Corasick":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho-Corasick_algorithm implementation in C, found in "Strmat":http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/strmat.html package.

The source code (ac.c and ac.h) was "adapted" from Strmat. In fact, I've changed only 3-4 lines of code from the original implementation so it will feat my needs: search needed to return the current position in the searched string.

h3. Okay, so what's the idea?

Having a dictionary of known sentences (note: not *words*!), this kick ass algorithm can find individual patterns in an incoming stream of data. Kinda Fast.

The algorithm has 2 stages: one where an internal tree in being build from the given dictionary leaving the search to the second step.

h3. Okay, so where can I use this?

Well, you can do some crazy things with it, like, you can lookup for DNA patterns or maybe analyze network sequences (read: strange and maybe proprietary network protocols), or domestic stuff like building contextual links on your blog posts to enrich your users experience.

h3. Okay, so how can I install it?

If you don't have github surces, type:

<pre>
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
</pre>

then,

<pre>
gem install aurelian-ruby-ahocorasick
</pre>

h5. Note 1

I'm still thinking if I should publish this gem to rubyforge too.

h5. Note 2

It's known to work/compile/install on Ubuntu 8.04 and Mac OS 10.4.something. It should work more or less out of the box if you have gcc around.
I don't have any knowledge of Microsoft compilers
